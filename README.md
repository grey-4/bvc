# BVC - Bluetooth Voice Communication

A short-distance voice communication system utilizing Bluetooth technology for peer-to-peer audio calls with intelligent path-finding capabilities.

## Overview

BVC (Bluetooth Voice Communication) is a decentralized voice communication system designed for short-range scenarios where traditional cellular or WiFi infrastructure may be unavailable or unreliable. The system leverages Bluetooth's broadcasting capabilities and implements custom routing protocols to establish voice communication paths between devices.

## Features

- **Short-Range Voice Communication**: Direct peer-to-peer voice calls within Bluetooth range (~10-100 meters)
- **Mesh Networking**: Multi-hop routing through intermediate devices to extend communication range
- **Broadcasting Protocol**: Efficient device discovery and network topology mapping
- **Adaptive Path Finding**: Dynamic route selection based on signal strength and network conditions
- **Low Latency Audio**: Optimized audio encoding and transmission for real-time communication
- **Battery Efficient**: Power-optimized protocols to maximize device battery life

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Discovery Service**: Handles device discovery and network topology mapping
2. **Routing Engine**: Implements path-finding algorithms for multi-hop communication
3. **Audio Engine**: Manages audio capture, encoding, decoding, and playback
4. **Protocol Stack**: Custom Bluetooth protocols for reliable voice transmission
5. **Network Manager**: Maintains connections and handles network state changes

### Communication Protocols

#### Device Discovery Protocol
- Periodic advertising of device capabilities and availability
- Neighbor discovery and signal strength measurement
- Network topology construction and maintenance

#### Routing Protocol
- **Algorithm**: Hybrid approach combining:
  - Distance Vector routing for basic path establishment
  - Link State updates for topology changes
  - Quality-based metrics (RSSI, latency, battery level)
- **Path Selection Criteria**:
  - Minimum hop count
  - Maximum signal strength
  - Lowest latency
  - Battery availability of intermediate nodes

#### Voice Transport Protocol
- Real-time voice packet transmission
- Forward Error Correction (FEC) for packet loss recovery
- Adaptive bitrate based on link quality
- Jitter buffer management for smooth audio playback

Manages voice call lifecycle and audio processing.

```python
class VoiceManager:
    def start_call(self, target_device: str) -> CallSession
    def answer_call(self, call_id: str) -> CallSession
    def end_call(self, call_id: str) -> bool
```

#### `NetworkManager`
Handles device discovery and routing.

```python
class NetworkManager:
    def discover_devices(self, timeout: int) -> List[Device]
    def find_route(self, target: str) -> Route
    def update_topology(self) -> NetworkTopology
```

#### `BluetoothAdapter`
Low-level Bluetooth communication interface.

```python
class BluetoothAdapter:
    def advertise(self, data: bytes) -> bool
    def scan(self, duration: int) -> List[Advertisement]
    def connect(self, device: Device) -> Connection
```
